# What makes a model good?

- We don’t ultimately care about how well your model fits your data.

- What we really care about is how well your model describes the process that generated your data.

- Why? Because the data set you have is but one sample from a universe of possible data sets, and you want a model that would work for any data set from that universe

# What is a “Model”?

 - A “model” is a general specification of relationships among variables. 
     - E.G. Linear Regression: or $ Price = \beta_1*Time +  \beta_0 + \epsilon$


 

 - A “trained model” is a particular model with parameters estimated using some training data.

# Remember Expected Value? How is it connected to bias and variance?
- The expected value of a quantity is the weighted average of that quantity across all possible samples

![6 sided die](https://media.giphy.com/media/sRJdpUSr7W0AiQ3RcM/giphy.gif)

- for a 6 sided die, another way to think about the expected value is the arithmetic mean of the rolls of a very large number of independent samples.  

### The expected value of a 6-sided die is:

- Now lets imagine we create a model that always predicts a roll of 3.

    - The bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the average roll of the die as we roll more and more times.
        - What is the bias of a model that alway predicts 3? 
   
   
    - The variance is the average difference between each individual prediction and the average prediction of our model as we roll more and more times.
        - What is the variance of that model?

# 2. Defining Error: prediction error and irreducible error



### Regression fit statistics are often called “error”
 - Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)
 $ {\displaystyle \operatorname {SSE} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i}-{\hat {Y_{i}}})^{2}.} $
 - Mean Squared Error (MSE) 
 
 $ {\displaystyle \operatorname {MSE} ={\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i}-{\hat {Y_{i}}})^{2}.} $
 
 - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
 $ {\displaystyle \operatorname 
  {RMSE} =\sqrt{MSE}} $

 All are calculated using residuals    

![residuals](img/residuals.png)


# Individual Code: Turn Off Screen

 - Fit a quick and dirty linear regression model
 - Store predictions in the y_hat variable using predict() from the fit model
 - handcode SSE
 - Divide by the length of array to find Mean Squared Error
 - Make sure MSE equals sklearn's mean_squared_error function
 


```python

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
np.random.seed(42)
df = pd.read_csv('data/king_county.csv', index_col='id')
df = df.iloc[:,:12]
X = df.drop('price', axis=1)
y = df.price
lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(X,y)

y_hat = lr.predict(X)

sse = sum((y_hat - y)**2)
mse = sse/len(y_hat)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
print(mean_squared_error(y, y_hat))
print(mse)
print(rmse)
```

## This error can be broken up into parts:

![defining error](img/defining_error.png)

There will always be some random, irreducible error inherent in the data.  Real data always has noise.

The goal of modeling is to reduce the prediction error, which is the difference between our model and the realworld processes from which our data is generated.

# 3. Define prediction error as a combination of bias and variance

$\Large Total\ Error\ = Prediction\ Error+ Irreducible\ Error$

Our prediction error can be further broken down into error due to bias and error due to variance.

$\Large Total\ Error = Model\ Bias^2 + Model\ Variance + Irreducible\ Error$



**Model Bias** is the expected prediction error of the expected trained model

> In other words, if you were to train multiple models on different samples, what would be the average difference between the prediction and the real value.

**Model Variance** is the expected variation in predictions, relative to your expected trained model

> In other words, what would be the average difference between any one model's prediction and the average of all the predictions .



# Thought Experiment

1. Imagine you've collected 23 different training sets for the same problem.
2. Now imagine using one algorithm to train 23 models, one for each of your training sets.
3. Bias vs. variance refers to the accuracy vs. consistency of the models trained by your algorithm.

# 4.  Explore Bias Variance Tradeoff

**High bias** algorithms tend to be less complex, with simple or rigid underlying structure.

+ They train models that are consistent, but inaccurate on average.
+ These include linear or parametric algorithms such as regression and naive Bayes.
+ For linear, perhaps some assumptions about our feature set could lead to high bias. 
      - We did not include the correct predictors
      - We did not take interactions into account
      - In linear, we missed a non-linear relationship (polynomial). 
      
High bias models are **underfit**

On the other hand, **high variance** algorithms tend to be more complex, with flexible underlying structure.

+ They train models that are accurate on average, but inconsistent.
+ These include non-linear or non-parametric algorithms such as decision trees and nearest neighbors.
+ For linear, perhaps we included an unreasonably large amount of predictors. 
      - We created new features by squaring and cubing each feature
+ High variance models are modeling the noise in our data

High variance models are **overfit**



While we build our models, we have to keep this relationship in mind.  If we build complex models, we risk overfitting our models.  Their predictions will vary greatly when introduced to new data.  If our models are too simple, the predictions as a whole will be inaccurate.   

The goal is to build a model with enough complexity to be accurate, but not too much complexity to be erratic.

# 5. Train Test Split

It is hard to know if your model is too simple or complex by just using it on training data.

We can hold out part of our training sample, and use it as a test sample and use it to monitor our prediction error.

This allows us to evaluate whether our model has the right balance of bias/variance.

* **training set** —a subset to train a model.
* **test set**—a subset to test the trained model.


**How do we know if our model is overfitting or underfitting?**


If our model is not performing well on the training  data, we are probably underfitting it.  


To know if our  model is overfitting the data, we need  to test our model on unseen data. 
We then measure our performance on the unseen data. 

If the model performs way worse on the  unseen data, it is probably  overfitting the data.

### Should you ever fit on your test set?  


![no](https://media.giphy.com/media/d10dMmzqCYqQ0/giphy.gif)


**Never fit on test data.** If you are seeing surprisingly good results on your evaluation metrics, it might be a sign that you are accidentally training on the test set. 



Let's go back to our KC housing data without the polynomial transformation.

Now, we create a train-test split via the sklearn model selection package.

A .513 R-squared reflects a model that explains aabout half of the total variance in the data. 

### Knowledge check
How would you describe the bias of the model based on the above training R^2?


```python
"A model with a .513 R^2 has a fairly high bias."
```




    'A model with a .513 R^2 has a relatively high bias.'



Next, we test how well the model performs on the unseen test data. Remember, we do not fit the model again. The model has calculated the optimal parameters learning from the training set.  


The difference between the train and test scores are low.

What does that indicate about variance?


```python
'The model has low variance'
```




    'The model has low variance'



# Now, let's try the same thing with our complex, polynomial model.

# Pair Exercise

##### [Link](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/38395/standardscaler-before-and-after-splitting-data) about data leakage and scalars

The link above explains that if you are going to scale your data, you should only train your scalar on the training data to prevent data leakage.  

Perform the same train test split as shown aboe for the simple model, but now scale your data appropriately.  

The R2 for both train and test should be the same.



```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=43, test_size=.25)

ss = StandardScaler()

X_train = ss.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = ss.transform(X_test)

lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(lr.score(X_train, y_train))
print(lr.score(X_test, y_test))
```

# Kfolds: Even More Rigorous Validation  

For a more rigorous cross-validation, we turn to K-folds

![kfolds](img/k_folds.png)

[image via sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)

In this process, we split the dataset into train and test as usual, then we perform a shuffling train test split on the train set.  

KFolds holds out one fraction of the dataset, trains on the larger fraction, then calculates a test score on the held out set.  It repeats this process until each group has served as the test set.

We tune our parameters on the training set using kfolds, then validate on the test data.  This allows us to build our model and check to see if it is overfit without touching the test data set.  This protects our model from bias.

# Fill in the Blank


```python

from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

kf = KFold(n_splits=5)

train_r2 = []
test_r2 = []
for train_ind, test_ind in kf.split(X,y):
    
    X_train, y_train = X.iloc[train_ind], y.iloc[train_ind]
    X_test, y_test = X.iloc[test_ind], y.iloc[test_ind]
    
    lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
    train_r2.append(lr.score(X_train, y_train))
    test_r2.append(lr.score(X_test, y_test))
```

Once we have an acceptable model, we train our model on the entire training set, and score on the test to validate.
